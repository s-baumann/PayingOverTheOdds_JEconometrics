abstract = {Governments are the largest buyers in most countries. They tend to operate annually expiring budgets and spend disproportionately large amounts at year-end. This paper is the first to investigate whether supplier firms increase prices at year-end to benefit from this behaviour. We develop a novel method using neural networks to estimate firms margins from the bidding behaviour of other firms in procurement auctions. We use a dataset of Ukrainian government procurement between 2017 and 2021 to document significantly higher prices and supplier profit margins at year-end. We demonstrate how results change depending on the type of good, the length of the buyerâ€“supplier relationship, and the impact of Covid-19. Finally, we provide policy suggestions on how funds could be saved.}
